# Qslice Examples

Code to reproduce illustrations and simulation studies from *Quantile Slice Sampling* 
by Matthew Heiner, Samuel Johnson, Joshua Christensen, and David Dahl. 

Most examples use the `qslice` R package available on CRAN: <https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/qslice/index.html>.

Each of the `standard_targets`, `gprior`, and `DLM_river` folders corresponds with 
a section of the paper and has a corresponding README file.
